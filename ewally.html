<P><FONT COLOR="#FFFF66" FACE="COMIC SANS MS" SIZE="+1">Learning can be more exciting when you use technology.  Using the Internet and email, creating web pages and multimedia presentations, and using a scanner and digital camera will improve your reading, writing, and research skills in a very fun way!  E-Wally, and his friends, will teach the surfers about the history of the Internet and how it works.  This is a new summer program for fourth graders that should be totally cool.  Come and join us as we surf into technology.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#FFCC00" FACE="COMIC SANS MS" SIZE="+1"><U>E-Wally and the Quest</U> is a delightful adventure blending the mysteries of the computer with childhood fantasies. The hero, E-Wally, lives in the computer delivering mail packages. But he is not the only one alive in the computer - both good and bad characters exist inside the network. When E-Wally needs help, he meets his real-life counterparts - schoolchildren using the computer for homework. We won't tell you if the good folks win this one. But the story is full of excitement and builds suspense appropriately for young children. E-Wally and the Quest leaves readers with the promise of more adventures to come. - Kathleen E Kain (Amazon.com review)</P>
