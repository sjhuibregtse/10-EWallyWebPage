<P><FONT face="COMIC SANS MS" color=#ffff66 size=+1>Learning can be more 
exciting when you use technology. Using the Internet and email, creating web 
pages and multimedia presentations, and using a scanner and digital camera will 
improve your reading, writing, and research skills in a very fun way! E-Wally, 
and his friends, will teach the surfers about the history of the Internet and 
how it works. This is a new summer program for fourth graders that should be 
totally cool. Come and join us as we surf into technology.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="COMIC SANS MS" color=#ffcc00 size=+1><U>E-Wally and the Quest</U> 
is a delightful adventure blending the mysteries of the computer with childhood 
fantasies. The hero, E-Wally, lives in the computer delivering mail packages. 
But he is not the only one alive in the computer - both good and bad characters 
exist inside the network. When E-Wally needs help, he meets his real-life 
counterparts - schoolchildren using the computer for homework. We won't tell you 
if the good folks win this one. But the story is full of excitement and builds 
suspense appropriately for young children. E-Wally and the Quest leaves readers 
with the promise of more adventures to come. - Kathleen E Kain (Amazon.com
